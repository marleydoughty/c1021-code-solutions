User can Sign-up:
for a user to sign-up it starts in the index.js file
If the user is not signing-in then they will have to register an account.
When hitting the register button, then the AuthForm component will run which has a form input for a username and password.
The username and password will be rendered from the AuthForm component, but before that then in index.js the post method is called.
Before rendoring and creating an account, the post method checks to see if the username and password fields were filled out
  if either fields are missing, then everything is haulted and the nearest middleware function (app.use(errorMiddleware)) is called.
  if the error is an instance of a ClientError- then the ClientError component is called with a 400 status message.
  if the fields are filled out then the password is hashed and that information is saved in the database.

User Can Sign-in:
After creating an account, the user can sign in- in index.js the post method is called and if the username and password fields are NOT filled out
or NOT valid entries then the rest of the method is haulted and the ClientError function is called with a 401 status and message of "invalid login"
  if the fields are filled out but the password does not match any of the passwords in the database, then evrything is haulted and the ClientError
  function is called with a 401 status and message of 'invalid login'.
  if any other errors occurred that are not related to username or password entry, then the nearest middleware function is called and results in a
  500 status and error message of 'unexpected error occurred'
if signing-in was successful:
  the user is granted an access token and can access their account.

User can stay signed-in after refreshing:
in app.jsx, the handleSignIn method is called and sets the access token to local storage with the window.localstorage.setItem and then the componentDidMount method is called
and gets it and checks for it.

User can sign-out:
in app.jsx the handleSignOut method is called and the window.localstorage.removeItem is called and then the user state is set to null, meaning no
user is logged in.
